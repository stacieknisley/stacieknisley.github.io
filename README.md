Stacie M. Knisley Portfolio
This is a sample of apps and coding projects created by Stacie M. Knisley.

V-Ridge, Cleveland Live Music (CLM) and Gitbet apps were created from Case Western Reserve University Coding Bootcamp group projects. 

V-Ridge is an app to turn your refrigerator into a "Smart Fridge". Create a grocery shopping list, maintain refrigerator inventory and provide links to recipes through the API EDAMAM. This app was created using React. 

Cleveland Live Music, or CLM, is the app to locate Live Musical performances in Northeast Ohio. Users of CLM are able to locate live music any date selected. This app uses Bootstrap Datepicker, Moment, Mapbox GL JS, and the APIs Songkick and Bandsinstown. 

Gitbet is a responsive app where users make bets with friends. Users play by entering a friend's name, an event and the amount to wager into a table. This app uses Bootstrap Datetimepicker, Handlebars and NPM Moment.
